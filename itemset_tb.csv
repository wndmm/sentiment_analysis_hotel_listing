The room size is just perfect with large modern IPTV and other facilities but the bathroom size is really small (1x1,5) for a 5* hotel, even the 4* hotel have much bigger bathroom. The other issues is the sound proof is really bad, the noise from the busy street and Gasibu park below is clearly heard in the room and its really dissapointing for a 5* hotel. The parking lots is huge, I guess its the biggest basement parking lot for a hotel in Bandung, maybe its because of next to the hotel is a convention center and they shared the same parking lot, and maybe if there's an event at the convention center then parking will be an issue.

Lots of worker wandering around the house and some of them keep looking inside our villa and made us very unsafe and uncomfortable. We booked for 2nights and plan to spend the whole day in the villa but our plan have changed. We have to go out from morning until 5pm just to avoid the noises. My advice is better to check with the host before booking because the house which is under construction is very disturbing and the workers can see inside the villa. There is no AC in the room but they do have a fan in each room but still my kids were sweating when they sleep at night. In the afternoon on the 2nd floor its very warm. They only have 1 TV on the 2nd floor and the place quiet small for all of us (3 adults 3 kids) to fit in with just a small sofa. The capacity for hot water in the bathroom not much and not stable, sometimes we have to wait for few minutes until the hot water out. The best is the fresh air there, the kitchen tools is clean, nice pool with a clean pool water but the water was to cold to swim.

It is also located at remote area that require us to drive through an uneven road and small passage (only designed for one way) and quite far from main road. Parking space is limited to max. 3 cars with a confined access. Breakfast is served to the room but based on their very limited menu. No nearby amenities. Room is also sound-leaked as we can easily hear the voices from the other rooms. No tv cable. The hotel only have 2 staffs that served us for everything.

There's a sense of old and untouched items such as cabinets and other furniture. Bed on the top floor was a little creaky and the bed bench was broken (but hey, there's a bed bench, and God knows we don't sit there, so it's still perfect for placing items). The first floor bedroom was a little dingy, but still clean. Hot water was nice, bathroom was roomy. The stove was a little hard to use, but useable anyway. Stocked dining utensils, sufficient cookware. Sofas and chairs are pleasant through and through. TV has nice channels. It isn't actually far from city, but the terrain was a little tricky and it's in very quiet neighbourhood. Which is great if silence is what you want, but can be a tad bothersome for travels (Uber services do willing to go there; it's just the matter of getting there that wants neat Maps guidance). Located in Dago Atas, in November it was cold. There's no available air con or fan, but the air itself was pretty chilly so no complaints here. Ah, bedsheets seemed clean. Some drawings on the first floor were a little unnerving for the baby tho. Also, there's a bit of a stairs to get to the house. Not a problem, but it is a bit scary in the rain.

Check-in process is very easy since previously we didn't do pre-book. The hotel locations is quite strategic, quite close to the shopping area, there are many restaurants surrounding the hotel, there are also many giant trees that make it very shady along the roads and it’s make us more interesting for morning walk to explore the access to the pedestrians along the road.
There is a car park in front of the hotel and basement, in my opinion the room price is quite cheap, the receptionist is very friendly, the lobby is not too wide but I feel at home sitting for a long time in the lobby.
On the left side there is a Magenta coffee shop which also functions as a breakfast place, room we chose was not too big but more than enough for a rest, there is also swimming pool on the top roof were not too big but sufficient hotel guests.
Doesn’t have many menu choices for breakfast menu but in my opinion it's more enough with the hotel rate we paid.

Second, morning adzan is quite loud (4AM) from our club room, should have more soundproof in the room and this should have been notified prior to our stay as we have selected the room for comfort. Third, the check out was a hassle, we ordered bellboy to help with luggage, no one came and when we want to return the keycard it took so long-there should be designated check out counter.

In addition, there are carpet facilities that make us less cold when we set our feet on the floor. But unfortunately, the facilities and buildings that are owned are not well cared for. Natural hot water flowing from a private bathing pool, the water is not clear, and contains a lot of soil / moss. Maybe if the management could be more careful in looking at business opportunities, for this hot water channel it could be given a filter, so that the water that comes out does not contain soil/moss considering the price of lodging is also not cheap. In addition, the water in the shower for rinsing also doesn't work, maybe it can be replaced with a new one if the shower is damaged. Mossy bathroom walls may also be rejuvenated by repainting, to be more comfortable when used. For the toilet itself, the flush doesn't work, but a bucket and a dipper are provided to collect water from a small faucet, so that when used, you can use a bucket and a dipper to flush. In addition, the first time I entered the room, the bed linen was still dirty, it seemed that someone had used it before but the room had not been cleaned, just tidied it up without changing the sheets. Then the floor is still sticky and dirty. And a lot of flies in the room (he said because it was the rainy season), the solution could actually be to ask for insect spray. So not too much of a problem. Just for info only. So I had to intervene myself to clean the room and spray insect repellent to repel flies, and asked the cleaners to change the sheets. The drinking water facilities are very good, I did not touch the stove and cutlery facilities, because I was disappointed with the untidy and less clean rooms. For food, actually there is only a menu provided in the room, but if you want to order food we have to ask for the WA number from one of the people at the reception, and that makes me lazy to go back and forth, because when I checked in I was not informed of this. Therefore I do not use the facility to buy food through the menu, so I can't review what the food is like. Suggestions should be besides the menu, include a phone number to order food, so that tenants don't bother having to go back and forth to the receptionist. Or if possible, room telephone facilities are provided, because if we have a complaint, it's a bit troublesome, we have to go up and down to the receptionist, especially if the weather is raining all day. Hopefully the cleanliness and tidiness can be further improved, especially for hot water in the bathroom, please fix it. Because it is very unfortunate with all the facilities and the shape of this very good building, so it is abandoned and not cared for. This review is not meant to be dropped, hopefully it can be used to improve facilities, considering the pity for the tenants who have come from far away from the city when they see the current condition of the inn which is very different from the one in the picture. Moreover, the rental price is quite decent in my opinion.

And its very spacious for myself alone. The bathroom has a bathtub and separated shower (which is really nice), they provide a shampoo & liquid soap, and also towels. But they do not provide toothbrush and toothpaste, (which is actually okay for me, because I always bring mine) but in case you don’t have it with you, buy one travel toothbrush and toothpaste, it won’t be expensive anway. The location, it is located nearby the ITB University. So do not have to be worry about food, you’ll find plenty around the area. Everything in this place is great. Just a little note that the parking lots is limited, so you might park outside the building on busy days (but it is safe tho, I parked mine outside too at the time). And also if you’re planning to go outside or come back to the hotel / guesthouse a little late, you might need to let the receptionist or the keeper know before you leave. So that you won’t locked outside like I experienced. Long story short, it’s all good with a little notes here and there.

Check-in process is very easy since previously we didn't do pre-book. The hotel locations is quite strategic, quite close to the shopping area, there are many restaurants surrounding the hotel, there are also many giant trees that make it very shady along the roads and it’s make us more interesting for morning walk to explore the access to the pedestrians along the road.
There is a car park in front of the hotel and basement, in my opinion the room price is quite cheap, the receptionist is very friendly, the lobby is not too wide but I feel at home sitting for a long time in the lobby.
On the left side there is a Magenta coffee shop which also functions as a breakfast place, room we chose was not too big but more than enough for a rest, there is also swimming pool on the top roof were not too big but sufficient hotel guests.
Doesn’t have many menu choices for breakfast menu but in my opinion it's more enough with the hotel rate we paid.

Tried their buffet breakfast and it was pretty good. Their services is also good. What annoyed me a bit was their facilities. I asked for a smoking room, but there was no ashtray inside the room. Their TV program and wifi also disappointing, wifi was slow, troubled TV channels. The room was not as clean. Also, we have to ask for the slippers. Other than that it was okay.

They gave us the room no 1032, its headed to East (just in front of the Gasibu park) and the side window is headed to North (Dago and Mt Tangkuban Perahu view). The room size is just perfect with large modern IPTV and other facilities but the bathroom size is really small (1x1,5) for a 5* hotel, even the 4* hotel have much bigger bathroom. The other issues is the sound proof is really bad, the noise from the busy street and Gasibu park below is clearly heard in the room and its really dissapointing for a 5* hotel. The parking lots is huge, I guess its the biggest basement parking lot for a hotel in Bandung, maybe its because of next to the hotel is a convention center and they shared the same parking lot, and maybe if there's an event at the convention center then parking will be an issue.

It was IDR 700k until I got really disappointed for real. First, I called the receptionist and they said that the room still available for double bed. Then I ordered, I reconfirmed, and the guy said the room for double bed wasn't available. I was so angry because the gap of the time is just about 10 mins. But the guy is helpful by ensuring they can fulfill what I've asked. After I arrive, the worse thing happened. I expect the executive is real for executive at least the accommodation, but, the wifi is not working at all oh my God I should have to attend a meeting and I got trouble. Third, the food for breakfast also terrible. Flat taste, the only thing I could eat is just the omelette. The hotel is suit for the oldskool customer. Rata2 bapak2 semua disini.

Stocked dining utensils, sufficient cookware. Sofas and chairs are pleasant through and through. TV has nice channels. It isn't actually far from city, but the terrain was a little tricky and it's in very quiet neighbourhood.

Some drawings on the first floor were a little unnerving for the baby tho. Also, there's a bit of a stairs to get to the house. Not a problem, but it is a bit scary in the rain.

They gave us the room no 1032, its headed to East (just in front of the Gasibu park) and the side window is headed to North (Dago and Mt Tangkuban Perahu view). The room size is just perfect with large modern IPTV and other facilities but the bathroom size is really small (1x1,5) for a 5* hotel, even the 4* hotel have much bigger bathroom. The other issues is the sound proof is really bad, the noise from the busy street and Gasibu park below is clearly heard in the room and its really dissapointing for a 5* hotel. The parking lots is huge, I guess its the biggest basement parking lot for a hotel in Bandung, maybe its because of next to the hotel is a convention center and they shared the same parking lot, and maybe if there's an event at the convention center then parking will be an issue.

For me, the tents and facilities they provided were not worth the rent. Fortunately they upgraded our tents with better ones, although using hot water was a challenge.

Never have I ever thought that sleeping in a private, secluded box would make me feel that refreshed and relaxed. I was grateful that I booked the double sky pod all for myself though, it was spacious for someone with a small figure like I am. I love how cold the pod was and how comfortable the bed was. Since I booked the sky one, it kind of made me feel a little bit adventurous, which I enjoyed. The bathroom was clean and thankfully not that far away from my pod. The warm water just hit different when I took a bath in the cold morning of Bandung. The communal space was okay, not that crowded and packed with people-again, which I enjoyed.
